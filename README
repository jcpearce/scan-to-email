The application uses a FUJITSU scanner to scan mail
The mail is either just the surface or the surface and using the ADF the contents
After scanning the mail is inserted into the database and emailed to the client

The software flows as follows

- Initially OSIScan is called. It loads FXMLDocument.fxml
- FXMLDocumentController is launched. This handles user interactions. It creates an object ScanState that has all the information needed to handle a scan independently, who it is for, what type etc.. This is then passed to a ScanFXThread Thread object which is then run. The fxmlDocument is cleared and control go back to the user. The scanning and processing happens in background threads. It creates a unique id for the job which is a concationation of membernumber and system current time ms
- ScanFXThread extends Task<ScanState> which (I believe) is needed to run in the background with javafx threads. Once in it it starts runlater (?) In ScanState which this thread extends it has a ScanHelper object which handles the actual scanning.
  After scanning
  if contents is being scanned as well  
   it finishes the surface scan and then calls MailItemInsertThread to insert into the database and saves the usage to the database including the number of pages
  it then calls AfterScanThread
  If surface is called
  it scans and then called mailiteminsert thread
  and scanGmailEnvelope thread
